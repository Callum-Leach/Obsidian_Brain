# Reactive Programming and ReactiveX

Reactive programming is a way to write event driven code. A reactive code is composed of entities that react to events being emitted by sources. These entities apply transformations on these events, and return other events as a result. So these entities - named _operators_ - can be chained together, to create computation graphs.
